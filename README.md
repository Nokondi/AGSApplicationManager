The application system currently consists of a user interface that allows users to create accounts, login, and submit the forms linked to their account role (teacher, student, counselor). When a form is submitted, an automatic email response is generated containing a record of the form submission, and the form data is stored in the database. AGS administrators can access the database through the FormTools interface, which allows them to view entries, edit and mark them as accepted or not, generate reports and visualizations, and download the form data in various formats for archival purposes.

Future Updates
The following modifications will be made in future updates:
The ability for users to save forms in-progress and log in to complete them later
The ability for teachers and counselors to view previously submitted recommendation letters
Accessibility features
Additional security testing and fixes
Load testing
Navigation and interface testing and optimization
Additional form validation
Linking of applications to recommendation letters in the database, to make them more accessible for AGS administrators
